# PreToolUse (Bash|Edit|Write) + UserPromptSubmit hook — keep credentials out of
# files, commands, and the transcript.
#
# Two jobs, because the two cases have different remedies:
#
#   PreToolUse       -> BLOCK. A secret about to be written into a file or a
#                       command is preventable, so prevent it.
#   UserPromptSubmit -> WARN only. By the time a human has pasted a password
#                       into the chat it is already on disk; blocking the turn
#                       would not unsay it. The value is telling you to rotate
#                       it now rather than discovering it in a transcript later.
#
# Registering this hook is the opt-in: it runs with sane defaults even without a
# config section, because the cost of missing a leaked key is asymmetric. Tune it
# with .claude/discipline.json → "secrets": { "extraPatterns": [...],
# "ignorePatterns": [...], "enabled": false }.
#
# False positives are the real risk — a gate that fires on placeholders teaches
# people to ignore gates — so anything that looks like a placeholder or an
# environment-variable reference is ignored by design.
